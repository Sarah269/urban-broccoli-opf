## User Stories
<pre>

User Story:  Online Payment Fraud ML App Prediction
As an analyst, I want to input parameters related to an online payment transaction into an application, 
so that I can get a prediction on whether the transaction is possibly fraudulent. 

Acceptance Criteria:
- The application allows me to select or input appropriate values for each parameter.
- Upon submission of the parameters, the application processes the input and generates a prediction.
- The prediction is displayed on the screen, indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent.

User Story: Online Payment Fraud ML App Predication Accuracy
As an analyst, I want to see the probability of the prediction's accuracy alongside the prediction itself, 
so that I can better understand the confidence level of the model's output and make informed decisions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- After submitting the parameters, the application displays a prediction result indicating the likelihood of default.
- Alongside the prediction, the application provides a probability score representing the accuracy of the prediction.

User Story: Fraud Dollar Amount Analysis
As an analyst, I want to see a visual representation of the dollar amounts associated with fraud and non-fraud transactions
by transaction type so that I can analyze trends and identify transaction types with higher financial losses due to fraud.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The app displays a graph showing the total dollar amounts for fraud and non-fraud transactions, segmented by transaction type.

User Story: Fraud Transaction Volume Analysis
As an analyst, I want to see a visual representation of fraud versus non-fraud transactions by transaction type so that I can 
analyze trends and identify transaction types with a higher number of fraudulent transactions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The app displays a graph showing the number of fraud and non-fraud transactions for each transaction type.

# Online Payment Fraud Detection Machine Learning App

## Project
Streamlit app created for the Online Payment Fraud Detection Machine Learning Classification project.  The app classifies an online payment as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## App
[Online Payment Fraud ML App](https://urban-broccoli-opf-ds4hkcnyodocxxsqslo5xn.streamlit.app/)


## Tools
- Python, Pandas, Joblib, Streamlit, Scikit-Learn

## User Story
<pre>As an analyst, I want to input parameters related to an online payment transaction into an application, 
so that I can get a prediction on whether the transaction is possibly fraudulent. 

Acceptance Criteria:
- The application allows me to select or input appropriate values for each parameter.
- Upon submission of the parameters, the application processes the input and generates a prediction.
- The prediction is displayed on the screen, indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent.
  
As an analyst, I want to see the probability of the prediction's accuracy alongside the prediction itself, 
so that I can better understand the confidence level of the model's output and make informed decisions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- After submitting the parameters, the application displays a prediction result indicating the likelihood of default.
- Alongside the prediction, the application provides a probability score representing the accuracy of the prediction.
